And everytime I feel like this could go further, not only in terms of optimisation but rather in terms of sharing what I've learned.<br>Sometimes I face difficulties that require me to leave my comfort zone and this is were the creativity is necessary and where the learning happens. This place is about sharing what I've leaned, things that were not obvious at first and the ways I managed to solve (or work around) it!</p><h2>Who am I?</h2><p>I am Jonathan Lurie, I was born in France, where I studied computer science with a major in biological signal/image processing. I started to work as an engineer in 2010, mainly contributing to the satellite image processing pipeline for <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en">Thales</a>/<a href="https://cnes.fr/en">CNES</a> (<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pleiades_(satellite)">Pleiades</a>). Later on, I move to Canada and work on the field that was closer to my studies: medical image processing and visualization in the lab <a href="http://mcin.ca/">MCIN</a>, which is part of the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/">Montreal Neurological Institute</a> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGill_University?oldformat=true">McGill University</a>.</p><p>In 2018, I joined the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/bluebrain/">Blue Brain Project</a> lab of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique_F%C3%A9d%C3%A9rale_de_Lausanne?oldformat=true">Ecole Polytechnique de Lausanne</a>, Switzerland, to contribute on the development of the brain atlas. This involves quite a lot of programming, playing with signal/images/volumes/meshes for computing or visualization. For me it's also the first time I am using/contributing to a graph database.</p><footer><p>Original theme by Phil Hawksworth can be found <a href="https://github.com/philhawksworth/eleventyone">here</a>.</p><p>Last update May 16, 2020</p></footer></div></body></html>
