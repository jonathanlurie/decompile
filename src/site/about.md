The reason is actually quite simple, and the feeling I have about programming, whether I do it for a living or for a side project, is probably shared by many other developers.  

Let's see what is usually the process that wraps "writing code":
- you have an idea of building something, or maybe this the idea of someone else
- you think about what could be the right tool for that
- you start to sketch some ideas
- some seems ok, some quickly turn out to be bad
- you start to scaffold your project, set a structure
- you tackle some algorithmic points that you were expecting
- you wrap them nicely to abstract the complexity
- sometimes you realize the difficulty is not were you expected it
- you have some struggle dealing with things you are not an expert in
- you look out for help and people who were there before, find solutions
- you assemble the last pieces, connect some wires
- your project is actually taking shape
- you run some tests, it seems to be working just fine
- now you are starting to feel a bit proud of your work!

These steps happened and are still happening with almost every project I worked on, including side/hobby projects. And everytime I feel like this could go further, not only in terms of optimisation but rather in terms of sharing what I've learned.  
Sometimes I face difficulties that require me to leave my comfort zone and this is were the creativity is necessary and where the learning happens. This place is about sharing what I've leaned, things that were not obvious at first and the ways I managed to solve (or work around) it!


## Who am I?
I am Jonathan Lurie, I was born in France, where I studied computer science with a major in biological signal/image processing. I started to work as an engineer in 2010, mainly contributing to the satellite image processing pipeline for [Thales](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en)/[CNES](https://cnes.fr/en) ([Pleiades](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pleiades_(satellite))). Later on, I move to Canada and work on the field that was closer to my studies: medical image processing and visualization in the lab [MCIN](http://mcin.ca/), which is part of the [Montreal Neurological Institute](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/) at the [McGill University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGill_University?oldformat=true).  

In 2018, I joined the [Blue Brain Project](https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/bluebrain/) lab of [Ecole Polytechnique de Lausanne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique_F%C3%A9d%C3%A9rale_de_Lausanne?oldformat=true), Switzerland, to contribute on the development of the brain atlas. This involves quite a lot of programming, playing with signal/images/volumes/meshes for computing or visualization. For me it's also the first time I am using/contributing to a graph database.
